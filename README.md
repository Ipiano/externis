# externis

Externis is a gcc plugin that generates a trace of the compilation process.
It is inspired by clang's `-ftime-trace` option.

The trace files generated by Externis are in standard
[trace event format](https://profilerpedia.markhansen.co.nz/formats/trace-event-format/).
They may be viewed in chrome's [about://tracing] or similar visualization tools.

## Building

Building Externis is relatively simple. It requires a recent enough version of
gcc and the gcc plugin headers, cmake, and the `fmt` library.

If you're using the gcc provided by the  there's usually a package named `gcc-plugin-devel`
or something similar.

You can build and install the plugin with

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make externis
sudo make install
```

## Usage

If the plugin has been installed into gcc's plugin directory, you can run the plugin
using the following additional arguments to gcc:
```bash
gcc <regular arguments> -fplugin=externis -fplugin-arg-externis-trace=SOME_PATH/trace.json
```
